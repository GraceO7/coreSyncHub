# 🧠 Intranet Hub Dashboard

A responsive, accessible intranet dashboard designed for internal company use — built during a hackathon challenge using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The dashboard serves as a central hub for employees to manage their workspace, view updates, interact with their team, and access frequently used tools.

This project showcases clean UI/UX, dark mode functionality, responsive design, and interactive components — all built without any frontend framework.
